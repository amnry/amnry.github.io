											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Hi there! I'm Aman Arya, currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science at <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu" target="_blank">Stony Brook University</a>. 
											<br>
											With a strong foundation in machine learning, quantitative research, and model validation, I'm passionate about exploring the dynamic world of financial mathematics and quantitative finance. 
											<!-- <br> -->
											My research interests span a broad spectrum, including Financial Risk Management, Stochastic Modelling, Portfolio Optimization, and Financial Economics.
											<br><br>
											Before diving into the realm of data science and finance, I earned an integrated BS-MS degree from <a href="https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali</a>, where I specialized in astrophysics.
											<!-- <br> -->
											My master's research, conducted under the guidance of <a href="https://www.iiap.res.in/?q=people/personnel_dir.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Annapurni Subramaniam</a> at <a href="https://www.iiap.res.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore</a>, involved deriving insights from vast astrophysical datasets.
											<!-- <br> -->
											This experience honed my mathematical skills and sparked my interest in applying these techniques to real-world problems, ultimately leading me to the field of financial mathematics.
											<!-- I am a final year student pursuing a BS-MS dual degree at the <a href="https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Mohali</a>, completing my master's in Physical Sciences with a minor in Data Science. I am working on my master's thesis project at the <a href="https://www.iiap.res.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore</a>, under the guidance of <a href="https://www.iiap.res.in/?q=people/personnel_dir.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Annapurni Subramaniam</a> and <br><a href="tifr.res.in/~singh/ " target="_blank">Prof. Kulinder Pal Singh</a>. -->

										<dt>Kerry Interface</dt>
											<dd>My current project involves developing an interface that fetches the latest statements made by high-profile celebrities. The project requires a robust natural language processing system, so I'm exploring different techniques to enhance our NLP pipeline. Specifically, I'm investigating how to integrate a neural network-based coreference resolution tool. I'm utilizing a cutting-edge span-based model called SpERT for joint entity and relation extraction to achieve this. What makes <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07755" target="_blank">SpERT</a> unique is its ability to identify overlapping entities that BILOU-based models cannot. I'm determined to wrap up this project before I graduate.</dd>

										<dt>News Recommender: Doordarshan</dt>
											<dd>
												As a team of five, we developed a cutting-edge News Recommender application that delivers personalized news articles based on the user's interests. Our objective was to optimize the user experience and engagement by maximizing the click-through and time spent on the app. Our project required us to create two intelligent bots for recommending relevant articles and profiling users. This project was an integral part of my machine learning coursework, and you can access a detailed report on it from <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=164duuCAC4UkYcv1xYe6zZkLbdUHQ1rEO" target="_blank">this link</a>.

										<dt>Speech Recognition System</dt>
											<dd>The goal of my project was to classify unknown phonemes from a dataset of 100 × 40 Melspectrograms using machine learning techniques. To achieve this, I converted the spectrograms into a linear format and fed them into a three-layered Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) implemented in TensorFlow, with 120, 60, and 30 nodes. However, after 15 epochs of training, the model only achieved an accuracy of 30%. To improve the results, I created a random forest model by combining the outputs of MLP, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models. This approach increased the accuracy to 55%, which demonstrated the effectiveness of ensemble learning.</dd>

										<dt>Dynamics of Galactic Star Clusters</dt>
											<dd>This project is the focus of my master's thesis. Using data from the massive <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Gaia">Gaia</a> mission catalog, we uncover astrophysical insights by analyzing the orbital motion of numerous open clusters. By understanding their dynamical evolution, we can better comprehend their impact on the abundance gradient's time evolution in the galactic disk. To achieve this, we utilize GalPy, a python-based library, to integrate cluster orbits and evaluate numerous orbit parameters across a range of potential milky models.</dd>

										<dt>Open Clusters: Binary Fraction & Oort's constants</dt>
											<dd>Galactic Open Clusters have always been a favorite tool for astronomers to unravel the mysteries of stellar and galactic dynamics. In our latest study, we use the vast archive of Gaia data to probe the intriguing properties of these clusters. First and foremost, we scrutinize the completeness of the number of open clusters that reside around our solar neighborhood. Moving on, we delve into the fascinating events that take place in the distant regions of the galactic disk, which profoundly impact star formation in the galaxy. Our analysis also closely examines the correlation between the Binary fraction value of the cluster and its age, in addition to checking for any differences between young and old open clusters that can be observed.</dd>

								<h2>Extracurricular</h2>
								<p>As a person with diverse interests, I am drawn to many engaging activities. One of my passions is photography, which allows me to capture the world's beauty through my lens. I have shared a few snapshots of my work in urban and natural settings, which I hope you will enjoy. Another interest I have pursued with great enthusiasm is dancing, particularly Bhangra, our lively folk dance. I have led my institute team to victory in numerous competitions and events and even held several dance workshops for freshmen students. Here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AashkeScientistsdoingBhangra" target="_blank">link</a> to our dance team's YouTube channel.</p>
